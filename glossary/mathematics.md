## Euclidean distance
A point in n-dimensional Euclidean space has n coordinates:

![](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=A=(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n))

Given two points in a Euclidean space, A and B, the distance between them is:

![](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=d(A,B)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2})

This formula can be proven by repeatedly applying the Pythagorean theorem.
